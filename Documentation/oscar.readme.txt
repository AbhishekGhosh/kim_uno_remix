Oscar's original notes:

Notes:
- subdirectory KIMUNO contains the Arduino source code.
- subdirectory KIMPC contains a PC version used during debugging.
  it compiles under any plain C compiler and gives the same functionality as the
  Arduino version, except that the 6502 Programmable Calculator mode is more primitive.
  This is code only used during development, but maybe it's of some use to someone.
  note that the cpu.c is the same as for the Arduino version! Only the emulator wrapper is different.
- This is not elegant programming. I'm a tinkerer, not a developer. :)
