To do:
- figure out why the console isn't accepting input
  - write a 6502 program, install it on the original code/avr and test it
  - see if that works here
- go through all of the convoluted keypad code to clean it up
  - it feels like there's a few layers of code that can be eliminated
  - convert KIM keypad scancodes to #defines
  - have all keypads sending those
